# MLA Fitness App

A simple and interactive fitness tracking application built with multiple microservices and programming languages. This application allows users to track their exercises and monitor their progress over time.

The Activity Tracking functionality uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the Analytics service uses Python/Flask and the Authentication Microservice using Java.

### Building entire project with Docker (+ starting containers up)
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

### Start existing containers (no rebuild of images)
```sh
docker-compose up
```

#### Spinning up a single service
```sh
docker-compose up [servicename]
```

#### Shutting down a service
```sh
docker-compose down [servicename]
```


## Development without using Docker-Compose

#### Running Node.js Activity Tracker

```sh
cd activity-tracking
npm install
nodemon server
```

#### Running Flask application
```sh
cd analytics
flask run -h localhost -p 5050
```

#### Running Java application
```sh
cd authservice
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew bootRun
```

#### Start the Frontend 

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

#### spin up MongoDB without docker-compose:
```
docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 -v mongodbdata:/data/db mongo:latest
```

### Connect to MongoDB

```
mongosh -u root -p cfgmla23 --authenticationDatabase admin --host localhost --port 27017
```

show registered activities:
```
db.exercises.find()
```

show registered users:
```
db.users.find()
```


## Deployment
The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed on any platform that supports Docker containers. For AWS deployment, a GitHub Actions pipeline is configured for CI/CD.
